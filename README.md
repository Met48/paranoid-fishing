Unnamed Game Prototype
================

To setup:

1. Download SFML 2.0 and extract to ./sfml
2. Download Premake4 and add premake4.exe to PATH (or add to ./)
3. Run Premake with desired build system (eg. "premake4 vs2010")
4. For Windows, copy all SFML dlls to the output directories (automation for this is WIP)
	- Output directories are ./bin/Debug and ./bin/Release
